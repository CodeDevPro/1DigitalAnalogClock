# DigitalAnalogClock
Online Digital Analog Clock using JavaScript HTML and CSS
This is a utility project where I have used JavaScript HTML and CSS to build a digital analog clock that can viewed in a browser. The clock has hour, minute and second hands. The base time is drawn from the system.
Then that base time is linked to javascript file to position and move the three hands by respective increments. The increments calculations are done to move precisely the number of degrees related to correct time.
Finally, every second function call is made to three hands to move them as explained above.
This project was a result of my hands-on learning part of JavaScript Essential Training course.
